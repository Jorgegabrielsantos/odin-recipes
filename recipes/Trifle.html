    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I call this easy red, white, and blue trifle an “assembly recipe,” because very little cooking is involved. Fresh fruit, yogurt, and berry syrup are layered in a clear bowl for a beautiful presentation. Layer in as much fruit as your bowl will hold, for a refreshing and easy summer dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 purchased angel food cake, cut into bite-sized pieces, divided</li>
        <li>32 ounces sweetened vanilla yogurt, divided</li>
        <li>1 pint strawberries, hulled and sliced, or more for a larger bowl, divided</li>
